# create-figma-plugin

## Introduction
This repository serves as a simple, no-fuss starter template for Figma plugins. If you're tired of navigating through overconfigured and complicated starter kits mostly built with Webpack, this one's for you. I personally prefer Vite over other bundlers and use it for all my bundling needs. While I can't officially endorse this package, it works well for my workflow, and you're welcome to use it for yours.

## Features
- Uses Vite for bundling both the Figma-side script and the UI.
- TypeScript is set as the default language.
- Utilizes React for UI development.
- Pre-configured with Chakra UI as the default UI library.
- Ready to use right away, no additional configuration required.

## Usage
To start your Figma plugin development journey with this starter kit, execute one of the following commands:

```bash
npx boraaonur/create-figma-plugin
```

Or, if the above doesn't work:

```bash
npm exec boraaonur/create-figma-plugin
```

That's it! You're now ready to start developing your Figma plugin.
